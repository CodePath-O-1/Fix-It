## Overview
### Description
An app that gathers homeowners, renters, and professionals to discuss home projects with ways to repair or fixes. Users are able to find professionals in their local area.

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Social Networking/Services
- **Mobile:** Mobile is a fast and easy way for customers and professionals to connect with their needs.
- **Story:** Creates a platform for demands in the form of home repairs/services which is not readily available in todayâ€™s world. By having a streamlined application that can both advertise and fulfill needs, people are more inclined to spread and utilize the application.
- **Market:** The clients can be anyone who owns or rents a home (mostly adults). The professionals are people who have licenses or certifications related to home/building.
- **Habit:** This app can be used at least once per year when cleaning up their home, when maintenance is needed or for remodeling projects. It can be used as often to ask questions, give suggestions, or to showcase their home projects. 
- **Scope:** Allow users to browse Q/A on home projects and allow professionals to advertise their services.
